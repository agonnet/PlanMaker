Church Service Plan Maker

This is software I was passed by the author before, I believe, he passed away. 

It is used to work out a church service plan from the set of church services in a district over a period of time and the availablity of the set of preachers.

It needs to be updated to a new Visual Studio version and/or converted to some more modern language. 

It is in use still!!
